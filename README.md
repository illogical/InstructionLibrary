# Purpose
This is just a collection of Agent Skills from other repos and a mix of my own for only the sake of convenience for use with the Awesome-Copilot extension making it simple to import prompts, skills, and instructions to other projects to inform LLMs on best practices while developing software.

# Folder Structure for Awesome-Copilot support

prompts/         Task-specific prompts (.prompt.md)
instructions/    Coding standards and best practices (.instructions.md)
agents/          AI personas and specialized modes (.agent.md)
collections/     Curated collections of related items (.collection.yml)
scripts/         Utility scripts for maintenance
skills/          AI capabilities for specialized tasks
